# ClassiQuote

ClassiQuote is the companion/test application for [MVC framework project, Ruby Reins](https://github.com/reinvanimschoot/ruby-reins).

To set it up, create a directory to store both this application and the reins gem alongside each other.

Like so:
- dir/classiquotes
- dir/reins

Then you can start the server with `bundle exec rerun -- rackup -p 3001`
